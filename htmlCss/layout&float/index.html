                        Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone[2][3] was born in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York[8] on July 6, 1946,[9] the elder son of Francesco "Frank" Stallone Sr., a hairdresser and beautician, and Jacqueline "Jackie" Stallone (née Labofish; born 1921), an astrologer, dancer, and promoter of women's wrestling. His Italian father was born in Gioia del Colle, Italy and moved to the U.S. in the 1930s,[10][11] while his American mother is of French (from Brittany) and Ukrainian-Jewish (from Odessa) descent.[12][13][14][15][16] His younger brother is actor and musician Frank Stallone.
    
                        Complications suffered by Stallone's mother during labor forced her obstetricians to use two pairs of forceps during his birth; misuse of these forceps accidentally severed a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of Stallone's face.[17][18] As a result, the lower left side of his face is paralyzed (including parts of his lip, tongue, and chin), an accident which gave him his signature snarling look and slurred speech.[18][19] He was baptized Catholic.[20] His father moved the family to Washington, D.C. in the early 1950s to open a beauty school. In 1954, his mother opened a women's gym called Barbella's.[21] Stallone attended Notre Dame Academy and Lincoln High School in Philadelphia,[22] as well as Charlotte Hall Military Academy, prior to attending Miami Dade College and the University of Miami.[23]
